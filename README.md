## James Usher
15; studying CS, with a lesser stress on product design. Little consistency with my projects and tend to do things that interest me at the time. Reasonable understanding of C++ but mains Python, with intent to learn Golang within the next few months when I get the time. My most recent project involved having an Arduino take http requests over HomeBridge to short the start pins on my home computer help me work remotely easier though SFTP or RDP. Limited but some knowledge of assembly, enough for a text game or very basic decomplication. Currently learning Godot, and gdscript though jamesbutbetter/evolutiongame. My previous project before Homebridge was making 3D printed missiles that I could drop from drones because I wanted to get some slo-motion footage of how rollerons worked.

Totally get one of those collapsible swords printed in a strong material, just having swordfights with people is so fun and you can get everyone different colour caps on the handle.

Trust me, I'm a professional. I'm just not sure what in, yet.

Concered about using pre-poisoned SQL links to mass get people banned from websites; and disk image injection
